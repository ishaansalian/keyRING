# KeyRING - Your Smart Key Holder

## Overview

An innovative solution for forgetful moments, particularly among college students. Inspired by the need to prevent lockouts, it combines an electromechanical system with a spring-switch, sonar sensor, and buzzer. The sonar detects door motion, and the buzzer activates only when keys are on the hook, offering a practical way to avoid forgetfulness.

## Features

- Smart detection of door motion using an HC-SR04 sonar sensor.
- Buzzer activation only when keys are on the hook, preventing unnecessary alerts.
- Ideal for dorms, ensuring keys are with you when needed.

## Installation

1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect the components according to the code.
   - Flash the provided hex file to the Arduino Uno.

2. **3D Printed Enclosure:**
   - Print the 3D models for the enclosure, box, hook, and mechanical spring.

## Usage

1. Place keys on the hook.
2. Open the door.
3. Experience the audible alert only when keys are on the hook.

## Inspiration

KeyRING was inspired by the common issue of forgetting keys, particularly experienced by college students. The project aims to make dorm life more convenient and prevent unnecessary lockouts.
