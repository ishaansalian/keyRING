# keyRING
An innovative solution for forgetful moments, particularly among college students. Inspired by the need to prevent lockouts, it combines an electromechanical system with a spring-switch, sonar sensor, and buzzer. The sonar detects door motion, and the buzzer activates only when keys are on the hook, offering a practical way to avoid forgetfulness.
